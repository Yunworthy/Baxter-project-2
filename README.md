## Introduction

This is my second Baxter project and my first solo Baxter project. This is also the course project of ME 740 Vision, Robotics and Planning in Boston University. The propose of this project is to estimate a spatial position of a tennis ball and a position-velocity movement strategy generated by myself(partly).

This project can also be classified into a visual servoing control method. Compared with my first baxter project, this is an off-line spatial target position estimation and position-veocity Jacobian control. In detail, this project can also be divided into vision and motion parts.

For vision part
